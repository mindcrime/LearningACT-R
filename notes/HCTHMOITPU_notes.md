# Notes from *How Can The Human Mind Occur In The Physical Universe*


pg 40-41 "3. Unlike the rational approach and some connectionist
approaches, ACT-R does not ignore issues about how the components of the architecture are integrated. Indeed, ACT-R is more a theory about that integration than anything else."


pg 42-43 "1. +Symbols, –Connections: The classic symbol manipulation position
holds that the principles by which the mind operates involve transfor-
mations of the structural properties of symbolic representations. This is
the position that symbols are like the symbols that appear in LISP"

"The claim is that, while the mind is not a
LISP program, symbols play the same critical role in the explanation of
mind as they do in a LISP program. There are two subtraditions—the lin-
guistic tradition, represented by linguist Noam Chomsky and by philoso-
pher Jerry Fodor, and the information-processing tradition, represented
by Newell and Simon. The latter position has threads in common with
the information-processing shortcut described above"


pg 43 2. "–Symbols, +Connections: This position is called eliminative connec-
tionism because it seeks to eliminate symbols in the explanation of cogni-
tion. "


pg 43 "Implementational connectionism believes
that connectionist computations are organized to achieve symbolic re-
sults and that both connectionist and symbolic characterizations play an
important explanatory role (e.g., Shastri and Ajjanagadde, 1993; Smo-
lensky, 1995). One way or another, this view assumes that connectionist
computations implement symbolic computations. For instance, in Smo-
lensky and Legendre’s (2006) Integrated Connectionist/Symbolic (ICS)
architecture, connectionist calculations can serve to enforce a hierarchy
of symbolic constraints on grammatical selections. "

pg 44 "One might also include dynamical systems (e.g., Thelen and Smith, 1994; van
Gelder, 1998) in this category, as Clark (1997) suggests. However, at least some practi-
tioners of this approach (e.g., Smith and Samuelson, 2003) have argued that their battle
with the greater common enemy (the classic symbol manipulation approach) means that
the connectionist and dynamic systems approach are really complementary."


pg 45 "If symbols provide distal access so that information can be brought from
one location to another, there is then the question of just what informa-
tion will be brought and how quickly that information will appear. This is
what the subsymbolic level is about. Symbolic structures have subsymbolic
quantities associated with them that control how fast the structures are
processed and which structural units get processed at which choice points.24
This symbolic–subsymbolic relationship reflects a very general theoretical
approach in science of postulating objects with real-value quantities—hab-
its with strengths in Hull’s theory (e.g., Hull, 1952), units with activations
and link strengths in connectionism, or electrons with energy levels."

pg 46 "Chunks have activations at the subsymbolic level. The most active
chunk will be the one retrieved, and its activation value will determine
how it is retrieved. The activation values of chunks are determined by
computations that attempt to abstract the impact of neural Hebbian-like
learning and spread of activation among neurons.25"

pg 48 "There are situations (developed in chapter 4) where multiple produc-
tion rules might apply. In such situations the decisions about which rule
to apply are determined at the subsymbolic level, where production rules
have utilities and the production with the highest utility is chosen. The
utilities of productions are determined by computations that are designed
to abstract the essential aspects of the neural reinforcement learning that
determines action selection."

pg 49 "Connectionist models have enjoyed their greatest success in describing
perceptual processing, while ACT-R models have enjoyed their greatest
success in describing higher level processes such as equation solving."

pg 50 "Human Associative Memory"  -- http://www.jstor.org/stable/1421672

"In his second paper, Newell (1973a) introduced his answer to
this dilemma by describing his first production system theory of human
cognition. This single system performed the diverse set of tasks that oc-
cupied cognitive psychology. The idea of a production system provided
the missing ingredient to convert the inert declarative representation of
HAM into a functional theory of human cognition.
I combined HAM’s declarative system and Newell’s procedural system
into the first version of the ACT theory (Anderson, 1976), which went
beyond either earlier proposal in assuming that there were subsymbolic
quantities that controlled access to the declarative and procedural ele-
ments. For declarative memory, activation-based quantities were used, in-
spired by the spreading activation model of Collins and Quillian (1972)."

pg 52 "Cognitive Tutor"

pg 52  "ACT-R came into being in 1993 with the publication of a new book that
was an effort to summarize the theoretical progress made on skill acquisi-
tion in the intervening 10 years (e.g., Singley and Anderson, 1989) and tune
the subsymbolic level of ACT-R with the insights of the rational analysis
of cognition. The “R” in ACT-R was to denote the influence of rational
analysis."

pg 53 "The last book in the ACT series, until this one, was published in 1998
(Anderson and Lebiere)."


pg 54  "Another important event since 1998 was the development of a successful
theory of production compilation (described in detail in chapter 4) with
Niels Taatgen, which brought ideas from the 1983 ACT* into the mod-
ern ACT-R world. With the theory of production compilation, ACT-R
now has a theory of procedural learning to match the successful theory
of declarative learning. We also began developing a theory of how such
productions could be learned from instruction. Learning from instruction
plays a significant role in the model in figure 1.7 and is expanded upon in
chapter 5"

pg 56 "The human mind is what emerges from the actions of a number of largely
independent cognitive modules integrated by a central control system."

pg 58 "The standard contrasts between brain and computer are
instructive here: the computer is fast and serial, and the brain is slow and
parallel.2 Feldman and Ballard (1982) proposed a “100-step” constraint
on action—many things that we do (e.g., decisions made while driving)
take place in far less than a second, during which our neural system can
progress through no more than 100 states. In that same time, modern
computers can execute trillions of instructions. On the other hand, we
have tens of billions of neurons performing these computations."

pg 61 "While different regions of the brain do their own processing, they have to
coordinate at least occasionally to achieve a functional system. Consider
working out a solution to an algebra problem."


"If one tries a particular type of solution rather than another
(e.g., factoring rather than the quadratic formula), control must be ex-
ercised to keep the actions moving toward that solution rather than the
other."

"Various researchers (e.g., Amos, 2000;
Frank et al. 2001; Houk and Wise, 1995; Wise et al., 1996) have proposed
that the striatum performs a pattern-recognition function—essentially rec-
ognizing patterns of activation distributed over the cortex. "

pg 62  "Graybiel and Kimura (1995) have sug-
gested that this arrangement creates a “winner-lose-all” system such that
active striatal projections strongly inhibit only the pallidum neurons rep-
resenting the selected action, which then no longer inhibit the thalamus
from producing the action. This is a mechanism by which the winning
procedure (in ACT-R, a production) is determined."

pg 63  "To achieve the rapid processing required for functionality of the mind,
different information-processing functions are computed as much as pos-
sible by different independent modules associated with different brain
regions. However, the need for coordination requires communication
among these modules. A particularly prominent sort of coordination is
where multiple modules communicate with a single coordinating mod-
ule, such as the procedural module associated with the basal ganglia."

"Simon (1962) noted that nearly all complex systems
whose design is driven to achieve a function have a hierarchical organiza-
tion of nearly decomposable subsystems. In this he included such artifacts
as books and computers, biological entities, social organizations, and cog-
nitive activities including problem solving and language. He argues that a
hierarchical structure facilitates the evolution and reproduction of such
systems. Specifically, it is possible to tinker with one subsystem without
disrupting another subsystem. "

pg 65 "The response tendencies of the central pro-
cedural module are represented by production rules such as the one
illustrated in figure 1.10. A significant architectural constraint in ACT-R
is that only a single production rule can execute at a time. Moreover, it
takes 50 ms for a production rule to fire—which I think of as the time
needed to complete the multisynaptic loop through the basal ganglia.
Since communication among the modules must progress through the
procedural module, it becomes the overall central bottleneck in infor-
mation processing."


pg 65-66  "It is interesting to consider what about the architecture in figure 2.2
might be uniquely human. Elsewhere (Anderson, 2005a) I have argued
that the goal module has unique properties in the human that enable hu-
mans to achieve a distance from their immediate circumstances that other
primates cannot. This enables human means–ends analysis, as described
by Newell and Simon (1972), motivating their early general problem
solver (GPS) theory:"


pg 66  "The key to means–ends problem solving is the ability to disengage from
what one wants (the end) to focus on something else (the means).
Papineau (2001) has argued that means–ends analysis is a unique human
capability. Means–ends reasoning underlies human tool making. Benjamin
Franklin claimed that tool making was the distinguishing human trait.
While there have been modest demonstrations of tool making in other
primates, Franklin was right that this is a capacity qualitatively differ-
ent in the human species. The goal module is what enables this capacity."


pg 70. "Fodor’s reason for doubting that cognition can be modeled compu-
tationally comes from his concern with the frame problem. The frame
problem was started in artificial intelligence as a technical concern with
how to update knowledge in logical systems (McCarthy and Hayes,
1969), and workable solutions have been developed. However, philoso-
phers such as Fodor have focused on bigger epistemological issues that
are only somewhat related. In Fodor’s mind, the real issue is informa-
tion encapsulation, and he argues that the knowledge that humans bring
to bear on a task cannot be bounded."


"Fodor talks about analogy generally
as being beyond the bounds of computational systems, and yet there
are successful computational models of analogy making (e.g., Gentner
et al., 2001; Hummel & Holyoak, 2003; Salvucci and Anderson, 2001)."

pg 71.  "Another serial limitation arises from the necessity for all modules
to communicate through the production system. Since the production
system can execute only a single rule at a time, it becomes the central bot-
tleneck (Pashler, 1998) in the overall processing. Therefore, cognition can
be slowed when there are simultaneous, different demands for processing
the information in the buffers of the modules. The idea that such a central
bottleneck exists reflects another emerging near-consensus in cognitive
psychology; ACT-R gives an architectural expression to this consensus."

pg 73.

"There are functional reasons for limiting production rule firing to
a single rule at a time. This avoids the problem of multiple rules mak-
ing contradictory demands on the same module. Thus, for instance,
ACT-R does not have to worry that different production rules will fire
that ask for contradictory changes to an imagined problem representa-
tion. In EPIC, where such contradictory rules can fire in parallel, explicit
coordinating production rules are needed to avoid such conflicts or deal
with them when they arise. While EPIC models come with special hand-
crafted control rules that seem to work, these rules are task specific and
would need to be learned for each new task. It is unclear what can guide
the system to form the right control rules; certainly people do not get
explicit instruction at this level of detail. No learning mechanism has been
proposed in the EPIC framework. In contrast, as discussed in chapter 4,
production learning has been a recent success story in ACT-R. Production
learning in ACT-R involves learning new productions from old; this is
easier to do if the learning mechanisms do not have to deal with simulta-
neous productions firing."

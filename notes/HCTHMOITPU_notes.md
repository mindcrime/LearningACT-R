pg 40-41 "3. Unlike the rational approach and some connectionist
approaches, ACT-R does not ignore issues about how the components of the architecture are integrated. Indeed, ACT-R is more a theory about that integration than anything else."


pg 42-43 "1. +Symbols, –Connections: The classic symbol manipulation position
holds that the principles by which the mind operates involve transfor-
mations of the structural properties of symbolic representations. This is
the position that symbols are like the symbols that appear in LISP"

"The claim is that, while the mind is not a
LISP program, symbols play the same critical role in the explanation of
mind as they do in a LISP program. There are two subtraditions—the lin-
guistic tradition, represented by linguist Noam Chomsky and by philoso-
pher Jerry Fodor, and the information-processing tradition, represented
by Newell and Simon. The latter position has threads in common with
the information-processing shortcut described above"


pg 43 2. "–Symbols, +Connections: This position is called eliminative connec-
tionism because it seeks to eliminate symbols in the explanation of cogni-
tion. "


pg 43 "Implementational connectionism believes
that connectionist computations are organized to achieve symbolic re-
sults and that both connectionist and symbolic characterizations play an
important explanatory role (e.g., Shastri and Ajjanagadde, 1993; Smo-
lensky, 1995). One way or another, this view assumes that connectionist
computations implement symbolic computations. For instance, in Smo-
lensky and Legendre’s (2006) Integrated Connectionist/Symbolic (ICS)
architecture, connectionist calculations can serve to enforce a hierarchy
of symbolic constraints on grammatical selections. "

pg 44 "One might also include dynamical systems (e.g., Thelen and Smith, 1994; van
Gelder, 1998) in this category, as Clark (1997) suggests. However, at least some practi-
tioners of this approach (e.g., Smith and Samuelson, 2003) have argued that their battle
with the greater common enemy (the classic symbol manipulation approach) means that
the connectionist and dynamic systems approach are really complementary."


pg 45 "If symbols provide distal access so that information can be brought from
one location to another, there is then the question of just what informa-
tion will be brought and how quickly that information will appear. This is
what the subsymbolic level is about. Symbolic structures have subsymbolic
quantities associated with them that control how fast the structures are
processed and which structural units get processed at which choice points.24
This symbolic–subsymbolic relationship reflects a very general theoretical
approach in science of postulating objects with real-value quantities—hab-
its with strengths in Hull’s theory (e.g., Hull, 1952), units with activations
and link strengths in connectionism, or electrons with energy levels."

pg 46 "Chunks have activations at the subsymbolic level. The most active
chunk will be the one retrieved, and its activation value will determine
how it is retrieved. The activation values of chunks are determined by
computations that attempt to abstract the impact of neural Hebbian-like
learning and spread of activation among neurons.25"

pg 48 "There are situations (developed in chapter 4) where multiple produc-
tion rules might apply. In such situations the decisions about which rule
to apply are determined at the subsymbolic level, where production rules
have utilities and the production with the highest utility is chosen. The
utilities of productions are determined by computations that are designed
to abstract the essential aspects of the neural reinforcement learning that
determines action selection."

pg 49 "Connectionist models have enjoyed their greatest success in describing
perceptual processing, while ACT-R models have enjoyed their greatest
success in describing higher level processes such as equation solving."

"In his second paper, Newell (1973a) introduced his answer to
this dilemma by describing his first production system theory of human
cognition. This single system performed the diverse set of tasks that oc-
cupied cognitive psychology. The idea of a production system provided
the missing ingredient to convert the inert declarative representation of
HAM into a functional theory of human cognition.
I combined HAM’s declarative system and Newell’s procedural system
into the first version of the ACT theory (Anderson, 1976), which went
beyond either earlier proposal in assuming that there were subsymbolic
quantities that controlled access to the declarative and procedural ele-
ments. For declarative memory, activation-based quantities were used, in-
spired by the spreading activation model of Collins and Quillian (1972)."

pg 52  "ACT-R came into being in 1993 with the publication of a new book that
was an effort to summarize the theoretical progress made on skill acquisi-
tion in the intervening 10 years (e.g., Singley and Anderson, 1989) and tune
the subsymbolic level of ACT-R with the insights of the rational analysis
of cognition. The “R” in ACT-R was to denote the influence of rational
analysis."

pg 53 "The last book in the ACT series, until this one, was published in 1998
(Anderson and Lebiere)."


pg 54  "Another important event since 1998 was the development of a successful
theory of production compilation (described in detail in chapter 4) with
Niels Taatgen, which brought ideas from the 1983 ACT* into the mod-
ern ACT-R world. With the theory of production compilation, ACT-R
now has a theory of procedural learning to match the successful theory
of declarative learning. We also began developing a theory of how such
productions could be learned from instruction. Learning from instruction
plays a significant role in the model in figure 1.7 and is expanded upon in
chapter 5"
